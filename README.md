# x86-64-Assembly
10 coding functions written in aseembly language!

`1` Find the sum of even elements in a matrix.    [ int sum(int *array, int m, int n) ]

`2` Find the max/min of elements in a matrix.    [ int max(int *array, int m, int n) ]

`3` Find the min of elements in a matrix.     [ int min(int *array, int m, int n) ]

`4` Partition an array (as in quick sort). Use first element of array as a pivot. [ void partition(int *array, int noelements) ]

`5` Compute the sum of first N numbers recrusively [ int sumN(int N) ]

`6` Check if a given number is prime.   [ int isPrime(int N) ]

`7` Check if a given 64-bit number contains odd number of 1s in its bit representation [ int parityCheck(int N) ]

`8` Reverse a string [ void reverse(char *str) ]

`9` Merge two sorted lists. [ void merge(int *lista, int sizea, int *listb, int sizeb) ]

`10` Perform binary search for the position of an element in a sorted array.  [ int binarySearch(int *list, int size, int element) ]

## Fibonnaci Programs 

`11` Write an x86-64 assemble language program to compute the Nth fibonacci number. N is provided through data section and you should store the computed fibonaccii number in the data section.

`12` *Challenge Problem*: Solve the above problem but take N as user input through keyboard and print the computed fibonacci number on the screen.

`13` Your fibonacci computation function should be in x86-64 assembly and you should call this function from the main function written in a C program.

`14` Your main function should be in assembly and call the fibonacci function written in C. 

`15` Write a recursive version of Fibonacci in x86-64 assembly.

`16` Declare an array in data section of your assembly program. Write x86-64 assembly code to compute the sum and max of the array elements.
